The Arlec Smart LED Globe RGB comes in two variants [B22 (GLD120HA)](https://www.bunnings.com.au/arlec-smart-9w-806lm-rgb-cct-bc-globe-with-grid-connect_p0111500) and [E27 (GLD122HA)](https://www.bunnings.com.au/arlec-grid-connect-smart-9-5w-806lm-rgb-cct-es-e27-globe_p011150).

They are part of the [Grid Connect ecosystem](https://grid-connect.com.au/) and are sold at Bunnings in Australia and New Zealand.
Prior to ~Aug 2020 they could be flashed with tuya-convert, however this is no longer the case (because of [this issue](https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert/issues/483)) 

The configuration is almost identical to the [Lonsonho 9W E27 RGBWW](/devices/Lonsonho-9W-E27-RGBWW-bulb/) bulb; see that page for configuration and instructions.
The only change required to make the colors work was to add `color_interlock: true` to the light configuration.
